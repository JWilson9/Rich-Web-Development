<p>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
</p>
<p>
Defeasible reasoning is a kind of reasoning that is based on reasons that are defeasible, 
as opposed to the indefeasible reasons of deductive logic. Defeasible reasoning is a particular
 kind of non-demonstrative reasoning, where the reasoning does not produce a full, complete, or 
 final demonstration of a claim, i.e., where fallibility and corrigibility of a conclusion are 
 acknowledged. In other words defeasible reasoning produces a contingent statement or claim. 
 Other kinds of non-demonstrative reasoning are probabilistic reasoning, inductive reasoning, 
 statistical reasoning, abductive reasoning, and paraconsistent reasoning. Defeasible reasoning 
 is also a kind of ampliative reasoning because its conclusions reach beyond the pure meanings 
 of the premises.

 <p>

The differences between these kinds of reasoning correspond to differences about the conditional that each kind of reasoning uses, and on what premise (or on what authority) the conditional is adopted:

Deductive (from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion): if p then q (i.e., q or not-p)
Defeasible (from authority): if p then (defeasibly) q
Probabilistic (from combinatorics and indifference): if p then (probably) q
Statistical (from data and presumption): the frequency of qs among ps is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if p then (probably) q
